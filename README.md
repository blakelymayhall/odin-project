# Odin-Project
Master Git repository for projects completed in Odin-Project curriculum

# Weather App
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-weather-app
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-weather-app/

For this project in my full-stack web development journey, I got the opportunity to develop an asynchronous web-app that utilizes an API. The project was to create a simple weather app that pinged https://www.weatherapi.com/'s API and displayed the data to the user. 

Also in this project were challenges to utilize Lint and Prettier modules, and I further challenged myself to make it mobile-acccessible. 

# Tic-Tac-Toe
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-tictactoe
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-tictactoe/

Continuing with the fundamentals of Javascript in web development, my next project offered by the Odin Project was to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

While implementing this classic game, it was encouraged to utilize the factory function and immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) Javascript patterns where applicable. Working this way made using Javascript feel a lot like typical, object oriented C++ and C#! 

# Todo App
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-todo
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-todo/

Continuing with the fundamentals of Javascript in web development, the following project was the capstone in the code organization section -- it came with many additional challenges!

The project was to create a todo lists website -- these can be very simple, but there is a lot of room for improvement and many features that can be added. I really challenged myself to make a complete feeling product, adding todo categories, filtering, sorting, searching, and more customization. 

This project also asked the learner to implement some additional lessons learned that apply to real-world javascript use. This included the webpack package manager, ES6 modules, and data persistence (the ability for a website to actually SAVE data on reload). 

# Restaurant Webpage 
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-restaurant
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-restaurant/

This project is intended to give the user some exposure to webkit and npm 

The goal was to make a professional looking webpage for a restaurant

# Library App
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-library
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-library/

Goal is a functional library app with a UI that shows what books are in the library
and gives the user the ability to add or remove books. No other conditions
are given.

# Calculator App
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-calculator
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-calculator/

The following is the cap-stone project in the fundamentals of full-stack web development in the Odin-Project. The goal is to create a fully functional calculator that can add, divide, multiply, and subtract via the nominal 'calculator order of operations.'

I found this task pretty challenging, as the logic to keep the calculator's running numbers correct and ready to be operated on required a lot of thought and consistent programming. My method to resolve this complexity was to introduce a mode and sequencer flow to the javascript. 

Once basic functionality was established, I committed the minimum viable product (MVP) to Git and began introducing additional 'nice to have' functionality, like a backspace button and a decimal button. 

# Sign-Up Form
Goal is to match a provided image. This provided fundamental skills in CSS and HTML

# Etch-A-Sketch App
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-etch-a-sketch
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/

Prompt is to generate a 16x16 grid of squares that the user will be able to change the color of by mousing over. I thought that it would be more useful if the program also required the mouse be 'clicked' so that the user could make pictures more cleanly. 

The program should have two functional buttons - erase and change grid size. I implemented both of these buttons in a modular fashion, keeping the design simple such that each function only does 'one' thing.

# Rock Paper Scissors
Repository: https://github.com/blakelymayhall/odin-rockpaperscissors
Live Webpage: https://blakelymayhall.github.io/odin-rockpaperscissors/

The original JavaScript source code for the rock paper scissors game was written in an earlier project during the odin-project.

This project is meant to give the student creative liberty to make a UI and provide functionality via JavaScript.

This will require code refactoring and iteration on the UI to be dynamic, and user-friendly.
